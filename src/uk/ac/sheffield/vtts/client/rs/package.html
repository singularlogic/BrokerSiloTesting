<p>This package contains service components and witness-types for testing 
with generated JUnit test drivers that test JAX-RS REST services.
It is part of the <strong>Broker@Cloud Verification and Testing Tool Suite,

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client.rs
</h3>
<p>This package is a repository where you may place any components needed by
your JAX-RS web service implementations.  Unlike the other service client
examples, there is no Java service client for REST services, since calls are
made directly against the REST API of those services.  However, we provide
this folder as a repository where you may place further types used by your
JAX-RS service implementations.
</p>
<p>
In general, you will use the JAX-RS development framework to build your
JAX-RS web service.  We assume that you will have used the Apache Jersey 
reference implementation for your REST service, and that you will have used 
Google's Gson to parse JSON responses.  When you generate JUnit test-drivers
for a JAX-RS REST web service, these will have dependencies on certain
Jersey and Gson files.  You will need to configure your build path to
include these dependencies from the library accompanying this source
code bundle (or by installing them from primary sources yourself).
</p>
<p>Apart from any service components, further kinds of domain object (such as 
the class <code>DVD</code> used in the <code>ShoppingCart</code> example) are
provided here, so that they are available to the generated test-drivers.
