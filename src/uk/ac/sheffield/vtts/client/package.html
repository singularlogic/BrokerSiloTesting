<p>This package is a repository under which designers should place Java 
service clients, to be tested using generated test-drivers.  There are two
sub-packages for POJO clients and for JAX-WS SOAP clients; and a third
sub-package that may be used to store any supplementary Java components 
for JAX-RS REST services (for which there is no Java client).
It is part of the <strong>Broker@Cloud Verification and Testing Tool Suite,
v1.0</strong>, &copy; Anthony J H Simons and Raluca Lefticaru, 2015.

<h3>
Package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client
</h3>
<p>This package contains skeleton service clients for testing with (some
of) the grounded test suites.  As supplied, these service clients are 
deliberately incomplete, to encourage you to modify them in response to
detected test failures.  Two kinds of Java service client, for Java POJOs
and JAX-WS SOAP services, may be found in sub-packages; but there is no 
special Java client for the JAX-RS REST service, since REST calls are made
directly via HTTP on a standard Apache server.

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client.pojo
</h3>
<p>This sub-package contains skeleton service clients that are "Plain 
Old Java Objects" (POJOs).  Target POJO-testers onto clients in this
package.
</p>

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client.ws
</h3>
<p>This sub-package contains skeleton service clients that are JAX-WS
clients for a SOAP service.  Target JAX-WS-testers onto clients in 
this package.
</p>

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client.rs
</h3>
<p>This sub-package only contains any service components or other 
witness-types that you may need for your JAX-RS REST web services.
