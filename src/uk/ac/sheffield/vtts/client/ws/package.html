<p>This package contains skeleton JAX-WS Java clients for testing with
generated JUnit test drivers that test JAX-WS Java clients for SOAP services.
It is part of the <strong>Broker@Cloud Verification and Testing Tool Suite,

Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client.ws
</h3>
<p>This package is a repository where you may place service clients 
that are JAX-WS Java clients for a SOAP and WSDL service.  Target 
JAX-WS-testers onto clients in this package.  We have only sketched the 
outlines of the two kinds of client object (a resource class; and an 
interface) with which generated test-drivers expect to interact;
since you will need to create the web clients yourself, using the tools
offered by the JAX-WS development framework.
</p>
<p>
In general, you will use the JAX-WS development framework to build your
JAX-WS web service.  The service implementation may have been created
 bottom-up starting with the annotated Java service, from which the WSDL was
 generated (using JAX-WS <em>wsgen</em>); or top-down starting with the WSDL 
 and generating the service resource classes (using JAX-WS <em>wsimport</em>).
 We then assume that a Java client is created from the WSDL (using JAX-WS
 <em>wsdl2java</em>).  This creates two entities, a client implementation and
 a service interface, against which all service calls are made.  The names of
 the interface methods must match the names used in the original service
 specification.  
</p>
<p>Apart from the service clients, further kinds of domain object (such as 
the class <code>DVD</code> used in the <code>ShoppingCart</code> example) are
provided here, so that they are available to the generated test-drivers along
with the tested service client.
