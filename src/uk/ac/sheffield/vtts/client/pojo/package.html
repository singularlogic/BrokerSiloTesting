<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.client.pojo
</h3>
<p>This package is a repository where you may place service clients that are
"Plain Old Java Objects" (POJOs).  Target POJO-testers onto clients in this 
package.  We have provided a number of complete POJO client examples that 
were developed to satisfy their specifications.
</p>
<p>
Some key aspects of these illustrative examples are: the use of the State
Pattern (in the sense of Gamma et al. Design Patterns) to model the different
responsive modes of a service, in which it either responds to, or ignores, 
different requests; and the ability to observe fully the request and response
behaviour, which is recorded as meta-data. 
</p>
<p>Apart from the service clients, further kinds of domain object (such as 
the class <code>DVD</code> used in the <code>ShoppingCart</code> example) are
provided here, so that they are available to the generated test-drivers along
with the tested service client.
