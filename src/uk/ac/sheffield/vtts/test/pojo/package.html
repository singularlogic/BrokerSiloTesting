Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test.pojo
</h3>
<p>This sub-package is a repository for generated JUnit test drivers that
test service clients that are "Plain Old Java Objects" (POJOs).  If there
is nothing here, why not create a JUnit test driver of your own?  We have 
provided some Java POJO service clients that correctly implement one of
the XML specifications in another package.
