<p>This package is a repository under which the test grounding tools will 
place generated JUnit test-driver classes.  It has three sub-packages for
POJO, SOAP or REST test-drivers.
It is part of the <strong>Broker@Cloud Verification and Testing
Tool Suite, v1.0</strong>, &copy; Anthony J H Simons and Raluca Lefticaru,

<h3>
Package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test
</h3>
<p>This package, or its sub-packages, may be used to contain generated JUnit
test driver classes that were created by the Broker@Cloud test grounding 
tool.  Since the usual JUnit convention is to append "Test" onto the name of
the service-under-test, and since this would overwrite one test driver with 
another for the same service, we also provide sub-packages to store the test
drivers for targeting different types of service client (Java; JAX-WS; 
JAX-RS).  If you don't specify any particular target packages for your
generated JUnit test driver classes, the command-line tools will use this 
package structure to store them.

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test.pojo
</h3>
<p>This sub-package may be used to contain generated JUnit test drivers that
test service clients that are "Plain Old Java Objects" (POJOs).  If there
is nothing here, why not create a Java client test driver of your own?
</p>

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test.ws
</h3>
<p>This sub-package may be used to contain generated JUnit test drivers that
test service clients that are JAX-WS SOAP web services.  If there is nothing
here, why not create a JAX-WS client test driver of your own?
</p>

<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test.rs
</h3>
<p>This sub-package may be used to contain generated JUnit test drivers that
test service clients that are JAX-RS REST web services.  If there is nothing
here, why not create a JAX-RS client test driver of your own?
