Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test.ws
</h3>
<p>This sub-package is a repository for generated JUnit test drivers that
test service clients that are JAX-WS implementations of SOAP web services.
If there is nothing here, why not create a JUnit test driver of your own?
The generated test driver will expect to invoke a standard JAX-WS web
service, generated using the JAX-WS toolkit.  For this, you will need to 
have generated two client objects, a resource class and an interface to
the service (normally done using <code>wsdl2java</code> on the published
WSDL for the service), which should be placed in the folder 
<code>client/ws</code>.
