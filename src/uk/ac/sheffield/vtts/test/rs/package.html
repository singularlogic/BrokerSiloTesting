<h3>
Sub-package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.test.rs
</h3>
<p>This sub-package is a repository for generated JUnit test drivers that
test service clients that are JAX-RS implementations of REST web services.
If there is nothing here, why not create a JUnit test driver of your own?
The generated test driver will expect to invoke a standard Apache Jersey
REST web service, and will expect to decode JSON response data using the
Google Gson parser.  You will need to add suitable libraries to your build
path, to handle the dependencies upon Jersey and Gson.
