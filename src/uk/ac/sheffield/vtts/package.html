<h3>
Package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts
</h3>
<p>
This package contains four command-line programs to launch the validation,
verification, test generation and test grounding tools individually.  All
have been compiled and executed under JDK 1.7, but have also been designed 
with JDK 1.6 back-compatibility in mind (for the sake of older web servers).
Alternative front-ends for launching the verification and testing tool suite
are provided in the sub-packages.  Altogether, there are three alternative
front-ends:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uk.ac.sheffield.vtts</code> - four command-line programs to launch
the verification and testing tools individually from the command-line</li>
<li><code>uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.gui</code> - a Java Swing GUI for launching
the verification and testing tool suite as a standalone application</li>
<li><code>uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web</code> - four CGI programs for launching
the verification and testing tools individually, as web services</li>
</ul>
<p>See the package documentation for the sub-packages.  General information
about the different tools in the verification and testing tool suite is 
available at: <a href="http://staffwww.dcs.sheffield.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/">
http://staffwww.dcs.sheffield.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>These tools depend directly on two libraries; but any test code you
later generate will depend on different libraries, depending on the kind
of technology you use for your cloud software services.  For convenience,
we have bundled the essential library files to accompany this distribution:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jast-1.1.jar</code> - XML marshalling and unmarshalling software</li>
<li><code>jsyntaxpane-1.0.0.jar</code> - XML and Java syntax pretty-printer</li>
</ul>
<p>
All tools use the <em>Java Abstract Syntax Trees</em> (JAST)
package for marshalling and unmarshalling, &copy; Anthony J H 
Simons, University of Sheffield, available from:
<a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/jast/">
http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/jast/</a>.
If working with JDK, you should install JAST 1.1 (or any later
version) in the same place that you unpack this software.  If
working in an IDE (such as Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.) you should
configure your build path to include <code>jast-1.1.jar</code>.
</p>
<p>The GUI front-end also uses the <em>JSyntaxPane</em> package for
pretty-printing XML and Java syntax, &copy; Ayman Al-Sairafi,
ACI Worldwide, Bahrain (hosted at Google Code), and extended by
Hanns Holger Rutz, SCISS, Germany (hosted at GitHub).
If working with JDK, you should install JSyntaxPane 1.0.0 (or any 
later version) in the same place that you unpack this software.  
If working in an IDE (such as Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.) you should
configure your build path to include <code>jsyntaxpane-1.0.0.jar</code>.
</p>

<p>
While these are the only dependencies required by the verification and testing
tool suite, you will generate Java code designed for JUnit 4.  We recommend
that you install the JUnit 4 library available with your Java IDE.  If you
generate code just for testing "plain old Java objects" (POJOs), then this
is all you will need to execute the generated tests.  If you generate code 
for JAX-WS SOAP web services, then this will depend on whatever Java service 
client classes that you generate from the service's WSDL, using the JAX-WS 
tools.  If you generate code for JAX-RS REST web services, then this code 
will depend on the Apache Jersey 1.19 reference implementation of a REST
web-server, and also use Google Gson 2.3.1 to unmarshal JSON data.  All
these packages are widely available at no cost.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
A service specification is developed in stages.  First the designer should
validate the specification, to be sure that they have chosen the intended
states and transitions for the service,  Later, they should verify that the
logical conditions specified for each operation are consistent and complete.
When the specification is known to be correct, and has passed the validation 
and verification stages, the designer may generate high-level abstract tests
from the specification, in a technology-neutral format, ensuring that all
the states and transitions of the specification are covered.  Finally, the
designer may generate concrete JUnit test-driver code from the high-level
specification, in one of several formats that assume testing either a SOAP
or REST web-service, or even a plain old Java object.
</p>
<p>
A service specification is developed in the XML service specification language
developed for Broker@Cloud, for which the XML schema (XSD) can be found here:
<a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/ServiceSchema.xsd">
http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/ServiceSchema.xsd</a>.
The website above also contains examples of specifications conforming to this
schema, as illustrations.  The four tools are intended to help the designer
develop a relevant and correct specification, and should be applied in the
given order:  validation, verification, test generation, test grounding.  Each
subsequent tool assumes that the specification has been passed by the previous
tools.  If not, then arbitrary results may ensue.
</p>
<p>
In the following, it is assumed that you are invoking each tool as a stand-alone 
program in the Java Runtime Environment.  You may also run them in your IDE, by
selecting your <em>Run Configurations</em> and supplying the relevant command-line
arguments.  If you do not, then the programs terminate with a brief statement of
correct usage.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: validates a specification looking
for missing transitions in the state machine.  Checks all handled 
and ignored events, so that the designer may be confident of handling
the desired events in each state.
<p><code>
java uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.ValidateMachine &lt;specFile.xml&gt;
</code></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Verification</strong>: verifies a specification for
logical consistency and completeness.  Checks that all the guarded
paths through each operation are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, 
such that there is no blocking or nondeterminism.
<p><code>
java uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.VerifyProtocol &lt;specFile.xml&gt;
</code></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Test Generation</strong>: generates a high-level test suite 
from a specification.  Simulates the whole specification model
(machine and protocol), generating test sequences up to a given maximum
length, and optionally compressing the results.
<p><code>
java uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.GenerateTests &lt;specFile.xml&gt; [&lt;testDepth:int&gt; 
&lt;multiTest:bool&gt;]
</code></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Test Grounding</strong>: generates a concrete JUnit test driver,
based on the assumption that the service-under-test is either:  a plain old
Java object; a JAX-WS SOAP web service; or a JAX-RS REST web service.  These
are examples on which to base your own grounding.
<p><code>
java uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.GroundTests &lt;testFile.xml&gt; [&lt;grounding:enum&gt; 
&lt;metaCheck:bool&gt; &lt;endpoint:uri&gt;? &lt;packageName&gt;*]
</code></p>
</li>

</ul>
