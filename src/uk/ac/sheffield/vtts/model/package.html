<h3>
Package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.model
</h3>
<p>This package contains Broker@Cloud components for modelling service
specifications and test suites.  These classes constitute the metamodel for
the tool suite.  This package should always be used by the JAST marshalling
and unmarshalling tools <code>ASTReader</code> and <code>ASTWriter</code>, 
which must be told where to find the Java mappings for parsed XML data.
The metamodel classes are designed with suitable API conventions for 
marshalling and umarshalling with JAST, which has the advantage that it
requires no special annotations on classes to be marshalled as XML.
</p>
<p>
The entire metamodel is designed according to object-oriented principles of
classification, with inheritance of common attributes and methods.  The
metamodel hierarchy is rooted in the type <code>Element</code>, which has
<code>Named</code> as one of its more important subtypes, since many of the
model components are named; and otherwise leads to an elaboration of concepts
including expressions consisting of functions, predicates, parameters and
assignments; finite state machines, with their alphabets, states and 
transitions; or operations with their inputs, outputs and internal branches; 
or test suites with their test sequences and individual test steps.
</p>

<h3>
Specification Concepts
</h3>
<p>
The type <code>Service</code> is the metamodel type standing for a complete
service specification.  It encloses the two types <code>Protocol</code> and
<code>Machine</code>, respectively denoting the operation protocol and the
finite-state machine of the service.  The former describes each operation of
the service's API in some detail, in terms of its expected inputs, outputs, 
preconditions and effects.  The latter describes the high-level responsive 
modes of the service API in which particular operations are available, or 
disabled.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Protocol</code> node contains a <code>Memory</code> node, describing
<code>Constant</code> and <code>Variable</code> parameters used later in the
specification.  The constants refer to ground values, or specific test values.
The variables refer to the fine-grained memory states of the service.  The 
<code>Protocol</code> node also contains a set of <code>Operation</code> 
nodes, each describing one service operation with its <code>Input</code>,
<code>Output</code> and <code>Failure</code> parameters.  Every 
<code>Operation</code> consists of one or more <code>Scenario</code> nodes,
denoting the different branching paths through the operation.  Each
<code>Scenario</code> is usually triggered by a <code>Condition</code> and may
optionally have an <code>Effect</code>, updating memory variables.
</p>  
<p>
The <code>Machine</code> node contains several <code>State</code> nodes 
denoting the high-level responsive modes, or states of the service, and each
of these contains <code>Transition</code> nodes that exit from that source 
state, and enter another named target state.  Each <code>Transition</code> 
has a label that corresponds exactly to the name of one <code>Scenario</code>
from an <code>Operation</code>.  This links the two parts of a specification.
Where no exit-transition exists from a given state, this is understood to mean
that the given request is ignored in that state.
</p>

<h3>
Test Suite Concepts
</h3>
<p>
The type <code>TestSuite</code> is the metamodel type standing for a complete
generated test suite.  It contains an ordered set of <code>TestSequence</code>
nodes, representing the tests to be executed on some service, in that order, 
so that all test failures are caught at the earliest point.  The testing
method assumes that the service starts from a clean state (after creation, or
after a reset).  Each <code>TestSequence</code> consists of a sequence of
<code>TestStep</code> steps, each naming an <code>Operation</code> to invoke,
the <code>Input</code> parameters to supply and the <code>Output</code> (or
<code>Failure</code>) parameters to expect.  The initial test steps in a test
sequence are to set up a unique memory-state, and the final test step is to be
verified, in the same way that a JUnit test author would write assertions to 
verify outcomes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>TestSuite</code> node is designed to receive a visitor (in the 
sense of the <em>Visitor Design Pattern</em>) of the interface type
<code>Grounding</code>.  Specific implementations of this interface will
generate platform-specific code from the technology-neutral test suite.
Several example groundings are given in another package, as illustrations of 
how to ground to Java, SOAP and REST, but it is expected that platform and
service providers will define their own groundings to match the particular 
platform technology used.
</p>

<h3>Expression Language Concepts</h3>
<p>
An important part of the metamodel is the <em>Expression Language</em>, a
mathematical language of values, sets, lists, maps, functions and predicates,
that is used by <code>Condition</code> and <code>Effect</code> nodes to 
express calculation and computation.  The language has a similar expressive 
power to the <em>Z Formal Notation</em>, but without quantifiers.  The type 
<code>Expression</code> is the ancestor of <code>Function</code>, denoting a
functional expression with operands, and <code>Parameter</code>, denoting a
constant, variable, input or output.  
</p>
<p>
Important kinds of <code>Function</code> include: <code>Arithmetic</code>, 
modelling all kinds of arithmetic, <code>Projection</code>, modelling pairs
and projections, <code>Manipulation</code>, modelling all set-theoretic 
manipulations on sets, lists and maps, <code>Predicate</code>, the abstract 
ancestor of <code>Comparison</code>, <code>Membership</code> and 
<code>Proposition</code> predicates, and <code>Assignment</code>, the only 
expression which causes a side-effect.  All other constructions in the 
language have pure-functional semantics, in that they do not alter variable
states.
</p>
<p>
The varieties of <code>Parameter</code> include:  <code>Constant</code>, 
denoting constants, <code>Variable</code>, denoting global variables,
<code>Input</code>, <code>Output</code> and <code>Failure</code>, denoting
respectively the inputs, outputs and exceptions passed as values to and
from operations.  All parameters must be declared before usage in a model
specification; and the model construction API seeks to resolve all uses of
parameters, as the specification is built.  A <code>SemanticError</code>
indicates that something is amiss in a model that might otherwise be parsed
as syntactically correct.
