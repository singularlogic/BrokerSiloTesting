Package uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web
</h3>
<p>
This package contains four Java programs designed to be launched by CGI 
scripts, in order to offer the validation, verification, test generation 
and test grounding tools online, as web-services.  All these programs have
been designed with JDK 1.6 compliance in mind (for the sake of older web
servers) but have also been compiled and executed under JDK 1.7.  Examples
of these programs in use may be found at the web site:
<a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/">
http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/</a>.  All of these
programs work in the same way as the command-line versions, with the 
exception of the test grounding program, which performs the equivalent 
of test generation and grounding in a single step.
</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>
These tools use the <em>Java Abstract Syntax Trees</em> (JAST) package for 
marshalling and unmarshalling, &copy; Anthony J H Simons, University of 
Sheffield, available from:
<a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/jast/">
http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/jast/</a>.  You should install
and unpack JAST 1.1 (available as the jar-file <code>JAST11.jar</code> in the
same place that you compile and install this software.  This will be in some
directory that is accessible from your web server's <code>cgi-bin</code> 
directory (see below).
</p>
<p>
You will need a web server configured to allow simple executable CGI scripts.
You will need to write four short CGI scripts, in your preferred scripting
language, to launch the Java Runtime Environment with one of the programs
below as the main class to execute.  You will need a web browser to submit 
web forms and view results as web pages.  You will also need to create 
suitable HTML web pages designed to collect the inputs required by each 
program and submit them via a web form, in the URL-encoded format.  Examples
of such web-pages are available here:
<a href="http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/">
http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Simons/broker/</a>.  Your web browser
must be configured to display raw XML files using a default CSS stylesheet.
</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
To run these programs under CGI (Common Gateway Interface), you will need to 
have a web server configured to allow you to run simple executable scripts 
under a directory that is usually named <code>cgi-bin</code>.  Here, you will
place small scripts which invoke the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with one 
of the programs below, on your machine.  
While every installation may be slightly 
different, in the following we assume that you have a <code>cgi-bin</code>
directory, and under this, have created a sub-directory to store compiled
Java classes, <code>cgi-bin/classes</code>.  We assume that your local 
JRE is installed at the absolute path:  <code>/usr/local/bin/java</code>.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to install the software is to compile the source code
from this software bundle, and install the compiled classes, along with the
unpacked classes from the JAST 1.1 bundle, in their natural package directory
structure, under <code>cgi-bin/classes</code>, which must be a <em>readable</em>
directory (but need not be <em>executable</em>).  The CGI back-end only uses
classes in the packages:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>
uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web
</code></li>
<li><code>
uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.model
</code></li>
<li><code>
uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.ground
</code></li>
<li><code>
org.jast.ast
</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
and the other source distribution packages are not so relevant (the software does
depend on standard Java packages).  Then, you will write simple
executable scripts to launch each main program, and place these in the parent
directory <code>cgi-bin</code>.  Illustrations are given below.
</p>
<p>
In the following, we also assume you have designed a web page to launch each 
program.  Each page will have a web-form which collects the expected 
parameters for that program.  The web form should use the HTTP POST method to
submit the form data, since each program expects to receive the web form data
on standard input.  The output from the program will be returned as XML data,
apart from grounding, which returns a Java source code text file.  You may 
need to configure your web browser to display raw XML using a default CSS
stylesheet (Apple Safari sometimes does not display raw XML).
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
Since Java class files are not directly executable as CGI programs, you
will need to write short executable scripts (in C shell, Bourne shell,
etc.) that launch your Java runtime environment with the chosen program.
The following example scripts are merely illustrative and do not necessarily
reflect the actual pathnames on your machine.  The examples each describe the
web form parameter names used to pass data.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Validation</strong>: validates a specification looking
for missing transitions in the state machine.  Checks all handled 
and ignored events, so that the designer may be confident of handling
the desired events in each state.
The web-form should have a text-field named <code>url</code> to 
accept the public URL of your specification file.  The submitted form
data should look something like this:
<p>
<code>url=<em>xml_spec_url</em></code>
</p>
<p>
Where the <em>xml_spec_url</em> is the complete URL pathname leading
to your XML specification file. 
The script to launch this program will contain a line like this:
</p>
<p><code>
/usr/local/bin/java classes/uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web.WebValidateMachine
</code></p>
</li>

<li><strong>Verification</strong>: verifies a specification for
logical consistency and completeness.  Checks that all the guarded
paths through each operation are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, 
such that there is no blocking or nondeterminism.
The web-form should have a text-field named <code>url</code> to 
accept the public URL of your specification file.  The submitted form
data should look something like this:
<p>
<code>url=<em>xml_spec_url</em></code>
</p>
<p>
Where the <em>xml_spec_url</em> is the complete URL pathname leading
to your XML specification file. 
The script to launch this program will contain a line like this:
</p>
<p><code>
/usr/local/bin/java classes/uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web.WebVerifyProtocol
</code>
</p></li>

<li><strong>Test Generation</strong>: generates a high-level test suite 
from a specification.  Simulates the whole specification model
(machine and protocol), generating test sequences up to a given maximum
length, and optionally compressing the results.
The web-form should have a text-field named <code>url</code> to 
accept the public URL of your specification file, an integer spinner
field named <code>depth</code> to set the desired test depth, and a 
boolean radio button named <code>multi</code> to select multi-objective
test generation.  The submitted form data should look something like this:
<p>
<code>url=<em>xml_spec_url</em>&amp;depth=<em>2</em>&amp;multi=<em>false</em></code>
</p>
<p>
Where the <em>xml_spec_url</em> is the complete URL pathname leading
to your XML specification file, <em>2</em> is a chosen test depth, and 
<em>false</em> indicates single-objective testing.
The script to launch this program will contain a line like this:
</p>
<p><code>
/usr/local/bin/java classes/uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web.WebGenerateTests
</code>
</p></li>

<li><strong>Test Grounding</strong>: generates a concrete JUnit test driver,
based on the assumption that the service-under-test is either:  a plain old
Java object; a JAX-WS SOAP web service; or a JAX-RS REST web service.  These
are examples on which to base your own grounding.
The web-form should have a text-field named <code>url</code> to 
accept the public URL of your specification file, an integer spinner
field named <code>depth</code> to set the desired test depth, a boolean radio
button named <code>multi</code> to select multi-objective test generation,
a text spinner labelled <code>ground</code> to pick one of the three 
grounding formats: <code>"Java" | "JAX-WS" | "JAX-RS"</code> and a boolean
radio button named <code>meta</code> to select full meta-testing of all
labelled states and transitions.
<p>
Further optional fields include a text field labelled <code>driver</code> 
to accept the target package name for the generated JUnit test driver, a text 
field labelled <code>system</code> to accept the source package name for the
tested Java service client (for non-REST), a text field labelled 
<code>endpoint</code> to accept the URI of the service (for REST only)
The submitted form data should look something like this:
</p>
<p>
<code>url=<em>xml_spec_url</em>&amp;depth=<em>2</em>&amp;multi=<em>false</em>&amp;ground=<em>JAX-RS</em>&amp;meta=<em>true</em>&amp;driver=<em>my.test.driver</em>&amp;endpoint=<em>my_rest_url</em></code>
</p>
<p>
Where the <em>xml_spec_url</em> is the complete URL pathname leading
to your XML specification file, <em>2</em> is a chosen test depth, 
<em>false</em> indicates single-objective testing, <em>JAX-RS</em>
indicates generating code for testing a REST service, <em>true</em> is
chosen to request full meta-testing and the other parameters are a package
name and the URL of the tested REST service.
The script to launch this program will contain a line like this:
<p><code>
/usr/local/bin/java classes/uk.ac.sheffield.vtts.web.WebGroundTests
</code>
</p></li>

</ul>
